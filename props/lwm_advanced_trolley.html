The iron cup surrounding the trolley pole was smashed and the ornamental knob at the top of the pole was dislodged and flung across the roadway and through the plate glass window in the shop of Mr. McNair, picture framer, destroying two pictures and doing damage to the extent of about \u00a3l2. The engine of the coach and the steering gear were damaged, though the driver and guard luckily escaped injury. A coach and three horses were quickly obtained from Messrs.

The power station, Mr. Tester told me, by the bye, is not quite finished. The tilec trical part of the work is all done but the carpenters have not yet cleared out. The station has power enough to driv e all the ears at one moment, and if the system were extended to Morecambe no further ad ditions would be necessary. It would sim ply involve a re-arrangement of the exist ing plant. That the extension to More cambe will come nobody can doubt for a moment. When once the public have tasted the joys of such luxurious travelling as this municipal development places within their reach they will for the remainder of their lives look with disgust upon a horse drawn tramcar.

E. Marshall, Esq., secretary to the U.D.C., Runcorn. Dear sir, with a view to promoting a scheme of electrical tramways, under the Light Railways Act, between Wes ton. through Runcorn, Norton, Acton Grange, Moore, Walton (Inferior)and Warrington,we beg to ask whether such a scheme would receive the assistance of your Council, in any application we might make to the Board of Trade. The idea is to run the ordinary trolley system of electric trams, similar to those working in Liverpool, Leeds, and elsewhere, and when occasion requires to at tach an additional car for merchandise and goods ; arrangements to be made with your Council to supply the electric current for the working of the system, within say two miles radius of your town. It is proposed to enter into further negotiation with the propes.d New Bridge Codpany, to run a branch route over to Widnes. The route chosen in your district will be entirely in accordance with your wishes. We send you an ordnance survey, showing the proposed route in red, but subkct to any alterations as to route you may require. If this scheme can be brought to maturity, the financial success of your Electric Light Station is assured. We have had a very considerable experience in Central Station work, and we know that if the electrical machinery can be utilized during the day, when the light is not required, the load factor is materially increas.d, and the cost of unit production is very much reduced. The average load factor obtaining in Electric Light Stations is only 10 per cent., but given an output for traction purpos:s during the day. this is easily increased to 20 per cent. This means that for lighting only the average works cost to produce a 8.0. T. Unit is 2d but with lighting and tree ion combined the cost , s reduced to ld. Now aroume the ranital cost of you: electric lightineschemc to be \u00a320,000, and that you sell at 51 per unit the average amount of electrieity which obtains forthis expenditure, this cc:fluid meaa 120,000 8.0 T. unite per annum, or \u00a32,509 The Traction Company would require a mini mum of 200,000 units per annum, which, sellino 2:1 per unit,would bring in an additional revenue nf \u00a31,666. Total revenue for lighting and traction \u00a34166, cost for ...mgt. nil, waste, water, repairs and maintenance. 320,000 units at 141, \u00a31875; interest and sinking fond oo \u00a320,039. \u00a3llll. total \u00a3llBO ; rent, rates, taxes,office, legal &c, say \u00a3lBO, profit \u00a3lOOO. For liohting only, your station would only post pay its way, if that, but with the traction combined we would ouarantee a minimum profit of \u00a3l,OOO a year- If your Council should consider this matter, we should be glad. We would, however, like to be consulted when the time is rip for ordering your engine and dynamo plant. in order that the came may be applicable to both traction and lighting. Our Mr. Bennett will be glad to wait, upon your Council to go into this matter at your convenience. \u2014Yours faithfully, BENNETT & WARD THOMAS", "annot": "A trolley-car powered by steam or electricity", "newspaper_date": "1899-12-08", "newspaper_title": "Widnes Examiner.", "newspaper_place": "Widnes, Cheshire, England", "image_url": "https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/8ef8395d-76c5-4649-821c-95c420de68ac.png", "image_url_conflict_values": null, "target": "trolley", "year": 1899, "x": -1.9271944761276245, "y": -2.6361570358276367}, {"Unnamed: 0": 363, "text": "FATAL ACCIDENT. -- On Thursday afternoon a wag. goner in the employ of Messrs. liantock and Co. was driving a hone au.l trolley contsining a barrel of cider oil the rola near Mr. Webb's Lougands, with his Nth gni on the top of the trolley. thi turning Lisa corner of the street the barrel suddenly fell throw ing the trolley over and the child under the horse", "annot": "A cart, or wheeled stand or table used to serve, transport or sell food, objects, luggage, etc, powered by people or animals", "newspaper_date": "1874-05-09", "newspaper_title": "The Stourbridge Observer, Cradley Heath, Halesowen & District Chronicle.", "newspaper_place": "Stourbridge, West Midlands, England", "image_url": "https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/320b9b02-1e5c-48fa-8655-6d52d4ffa6bc.png", "image_url_conflict_values": null, "target": "trolley", "year": 1874, "x": 0.27352091670036316, "y": 0.8890293836593628}, {"Unnamed: 0": 76, "text": "--\u2022 Tow is a fortune for the milliner who shall devise a bonnet that eau be worn in au y part of a theatre, and always present the trimmed aide to the audience. ttis Investment.\u2014\" .11ister,\" said the than witt the suspicious side glance, \"eau you tell me when the nearest trolley railroad is ? \" \" Certainly.' \" For one dollar and a half I ought to he able to rid about throe dozen times, oughtn't I?\" \"Yes. \" Well, I guess that'll do.

If it were not that each nation, like each irdividual seems to find its chief interest in selfish calca'ations we should never have these panics. We should see clearly that this \" shrinking\" 'globe exists for the benefit of all, and not for a few. But I want to take my fellow workmen along with me inithe search for some of the benefits resulting from 18th century research. We are told, and we only know it from being told, that we are better off now than ever our forefathers were. Of the thousand and one things that go towards making the path of life a primrose bed we should not have the least conception, were it not that the statistician and the politician kindly remind us of it. Sometimes a writer comes to the front and tells a bit of honest truth. Mr. Hobson in the Political Science Quarterly says : that the \" net influence of machinery is towards the increased irregularity of employment except in industries where the demand fo . the commodities produced is regular, and the supplies rekihated by the organized action of those who control production.'' Further, \"taking into consideration the two prime factors, namely, the number of those employed, and the regularity of those employed, machinery does not favour the in creased steady demand for labour.\" I have nothing to say against the use of maohinery, nor against mother nature giving out her secrets at the call of the scientist. Nor yet would I bottle up the inventive faculty. Let all have full play but above all things, we workmen must play our part, so that, as then we shall be able to report pro gress wticti called upon. I take the above quota tiors as being a solid fact.; being so, we need seek no further for the supposed benefits supposed to be enjoyed by the labourer generally. Were I asked in what direction is science making its most remarkable developments, I should cer tainly answer \"in the invisible, and almost un known world of electricity. Copper will, in this case, play a more important part in the wire mills of the world than it has hitherto done. I have no what the copper trade may be in England or on the continent. In the States it is a very large, and important one. For telegraphic purposes cop per is likely to take the place of iron, as being more durable and suitable, and, as to cost, cheaper in the long run. As we may reasonably look forward to seeing the higl ways converted into electric roads, so we may know that drawn copper trolley wire will be used for haulings and general locomotive purposes. Copper is mined in immense quantities in the U.S. In the State of Montana is the famous Allice copper mine. It has produced millions of dollars' worth of gold and silver, and is now yield ing large quantities of copper. The Anacunda is another. It was begun as a silver mine, but after running down a distance the lead developed into the biggest copper mines on record. Two thousand miners are employed day and night. Three thou sand tons of ore are shipped out from the mines daily. Here is seen the finest of improved machinery and all is on a gigantic scale. Here are the biggest smelting works in the world, covering eighty acres of ground The ore producing rock, containing copper, gold and silver, is pounded into a mash with great stamps and then filtered and re,filtered, run through process after process, until it comes out at last in the shape of a metal sand, which is taken to the other a orks and reduced to metal. There are at these works acres upon acres covered with grinding machines, and settling vats. After all these processes the metal is taken into vast rooms where the fames of sulphur make one feel as if one were having bushels of matches burned under one's nose. _ _", "annot": "A trolley-car powered by steam or electricity", "newspaper_date": "1893-08-05", "newspaper_title": "Widnes Examiner.", "newspaper_place": "Widnes, Cheshire, England", "image_url": "https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/4d52094a-adbf-4c4b-acae-72d29a357887.png", "image_url_conflict_values": null, "target": "trolley", "year": 1893, "x": 12.000503540039062, "y": -2.5964691638946533}, {"Unnamed: 0": 646, "text": "THE AIRSHIP OF THE FUTURE. \u2014An interesting article on terial navigation appears in \" McClure s 3lngazine \" from the pen of Professor Bell. The professor holds some rather original views on the subject. He maintains that the discovery of the balloen retarded the solution of the flying problem for a century. In his opinion, the fundamental principle of terial navigation is that the airship should be heavier than the air. He says: \" Elec tticity in one form or another will undoubtedly be the motive power for airships, and every advance in electrical knowledge brings us one step nearer to the day when we shall fly. It would be perfectly possible to-day to direct a flying machine by means of pendant electric wires which would transmit the necessary current without increasing the load to be carried.\" As a feasible means of propelling an air ship a kind of trolley system is suggested, the rod hanging down from the car to the wire instead of extending upward.

The name of the discoverer of the potato is unknown,but Du Candolle sums up the history of its discovery as follows \"The potato is wild iu Chili in a term which is still seen in our cultivated plants it is doubtful whether its natural home extends to Peru and New Granada; its cultivation was diffused after the discovery of America, and it was introduced in the latter half of the sixteenth century into that part of the United States well known as Virginia and North Carolina, and the potato was imported into Europe first by the Spaniards and afterwards by the English at the - tune of Raleigh's voyages to Virginia.\" ()alum Eous.\u2014ln Africa the eggs of the domes ticated ostrich frequently form a considerable item in the bushman's cuisine, and are esteemed by the hunters. When a nest is met with, it is often diffi cult to know how to carry away the eggs, and fre quently the jacket is taken off to form a temporary sack. The ostrich will lay during the course of a year about fifty eggs, of an average weight of over three pounds, which would represent nearly one thousand eggs of a Spanish fowl. The eggs have a taste somewhat less delicate than those of domestic poultry, but are nevertheless perfectly eatable.

F. Burrows (presiding),and other magistrates, the South Lancashire Tramways Company summoned Mr. George Shaw, managing director of .Messrs, G. Shaw and Co., Limited, brewers, Leigh, and four employees of, the firm for obstructing the company's tramcars. Mr. Blair, barrister, appeared for the Tramway Company,and Mr. Sutton, barrister, defended. The first c4se taken was that against Johnson. Johnson, a carter in the employ of the defendant company for obstruction on the 9th inst. 1 Mr. Blair said that on the 9th inst. a tramcar was going down Pennington-bridge, Leigh, in the direction of Lowton,and a brewery cart was coming up the bridge on its left or proper side. The road was too narrow at this point to allow the cart to continue on its own side and pass the tramcar, but the driver of the cart refused to crossover to the other side of the road and allow the tramcar to pass. The result was that the cart and the tramcar stood facing each other twent3 minutes, each refusing to budge, and at the end of that time the tram car driver reversed his trolley and backed to the loop at the top of the bridge. He submitted that the intro duction of the tramways had altered to some extent the question of the rules of the road, and that there had been ol struction. Mr. Sutton, for the defence, submitted that it was a misapprehension to suppose that a tramway conmany lied any right beyond what was given to any ordinary person. The case was disraigsed as were two similar cases. The Bench said they were advised that the Tramways Act did not appear to have altered the law existing prior to the Tramways Act as to the customary rights of the public with respect to highways, consequently the defendants were not acting unlawfully in maintaining their right to make use of their near or customary driving side, and the cases were therefore dismissed.

To .recapitulate the case briefly we may say that the deceased and her husband, Mathias Jones, who were somewhat elderly people, had formerly lived at Newbridge, and had only come to Bargoed about five weeks ago and had come to the house above mentioned, which is owned by Mr. and Mrs. Price, of Capel Street, Bargoed. At New bridge, according to Mr. Tom Howe, Mr. and Mrs. Jones had a most comfort able home, and that the deceased's husband had be en a sculptor in a good position and had occasionally attribu ted articles to the Press. Surely things, however, had changed since Mr. and Mrs Jones had come to Bargoed, for their home, which had the appearance more of an outbuilding than a house, pos sessed what may be described as the smallest minimum of furniture, and Mrs. Jones, during her distressing illness, could only be accommodated with what looked like a rough mattress on a low wooden trolley.

As to street railways, it has been impossible for the large companies,even with their facilities increased to the utmost,to any where nearly equal the enormous demand for the necessary electrical apparatus. Twelve months ago one machine.of which I had charge,turning out five miles of trolley wire a day, was found sufficient.. Now, there are two, with prospects of more,turning out 20 miles a day, improved machinery turning Out more work, but bringinzno more pay. Turning from copper there is bronze, and alumi num. These are metals now drawn as ordinary iron wire. The aluminum business is a rapidly growing one. The metal is a singularly light one, so 'much so that it can be used for all kinds of art and decoration purposes. It can be put to good solid purpose also. Aluminum horseshoes have been tried with remarkably successful results, it is said, by the Russian government. As an experiment a few horses of the Finland Dragoons were shod with one aluminum shoe and three iron shoes each. The result showed that the aluminum shoes preserved the foot better than the iron ones. None of the aluminum shoes broke and they were used over again for reshoeing. Horses are now shod with this metal at a cost of \u00a32\u2014the set. All the aluminum now being made is made by electrical processes. At present its cost is about 2s. per pound. It is ex pected in the near future to be down to Is. per lb. An aluminum and a copper rod of the same size would cost nearly the same. The production in the States is about 150 tons a year. The Metal Reduc tion Co. of Patricroft, Lancashire, produces over 300 lbs. daily. It is also produced at Stoke-on- Trent. I merely make, as it were, passing reference to these matters in the hope of drawing workers' attention to what is going on around us. I don't agitate for eight hours day.

It appeared that the prisoner had been suspected, and, on being apprehended by a detective, admitted that he had sold some spoons to a traveller. At the prisoner's house a large quantity ot plate was found, which was identified as the proceeds of several burglaries which had been recently committed. In each of the two burglaries with which Navin is charged the houses were entered b' the window, and the burglar got off with his booty without be;ng disturbed. Several other charges of burglary will be preferred against the prisoner. John Wished, a baker, has been charged at Ports mouth with torturing two half-grown cats.

The pri soner replied that the cats ought to have killed all the rata, and he threatened to kill the cats.

The first cat flew out whilst the second one was being placed in, but ultimately they were both burned to death. When charged with the offence, Wishart said that the cats were dead when they were thrown in. He was remanded.

Spencer & Sons, are placed 40 yards apart at the edge of the kerb, the arms sup porting the trolley wire varying from 5 to fifteen feet in length. In the centre of the town arc lamps of the alternating current type are suspended from the arms; the transformers for these are placed in the base of the steel posts, and the arrangement has proved so satisfac tory that an addition of 30 to the already existing 40 will be made before the winter. Owing to the large number of telephone and telegraph wires erected overhead, quite an elaborate system of guard wires has been rendered necessary, but with the eventual disappearance of -p-head telephone wires the necessity soon cease. The guard wires are of 'qed ir3n, No. 7-i, and are fixed 2 feet above the trolley wire; they efficiently earthed at different points. lance with what is now common the over-head wire is arranged in -mile sections, the boxes at these points containing four switch fuses mid two Garton lightning arresters. \"Two armoured feeders run from the -mks to a sub-station in the centre of the __., and from here three cables radiate Ward's End, King Cross, and Gibbet A telephone and pilot wire cable, ,nsisting of three 7/20 cables, is laid lg side each feeder.

By some it is conjectured that it marks the old landmark or boundary f Fordington, and others who places to know something of antiquity suppese it to be the remains of some part of a Druidical circle ; but be as it may, the Fordington residents of the nineteenth century attach a great interest and veneration to this I,ld stone, which, in their opinion, has \"braved the battle and the breeze\" for many centuries, The oldest inhabitants have related that when they were youngsteis the stone was regarded by their grand peeente as a very ancient thing, and no one ever dreamt of its ever being removed from the site where for so long a period it had been allowed to rest. Great indignation was raised when it was found, about a fortnight ago, that the etone had boon removed by order of those in high nuthurity at the request of a recent nrrival, holding the \"important\" position of parish postmaster, and daposited on the top of the Salisbury Walk. A letter appeared in the Dorset County Express, calling the attention of the act to the notice of Mr. Robert Hunt, who ,so well and faithfully represents the wishes of his fellow parishioners and it is to his credit he lost no time in bringing the matter before the Council at their next wetting, with the result that the matter was left in Ws hands to consult the Mayor and the wishes of the parishioners as to the most advantageous position for the atone. What idea was in the mind of Mr. Hunt it is not known, but certainly he intended to consult the feeling of the parishioners on the matter. The unanimous wish has been that no site was better than the urieinel one, and the men of Fordington, true to old traditions and determination, determined that there should be no further delay, and on Friday last a large crowd collected on the top of the Walks with levers an I planks ard set zealously to work removing the atone; all obstruction being removed, mpes were attached, and after a long pull and a strong pull from willing hands, the stone was hoisted on a trolley, a procession of workmen formed, ropes attached to the vehicle, and, to the strains of \"Auld Lang Syne,\" sung in high glee by the men, the crowd moved on in the direction of The Green. By the time they arrived at the spot to which the stone was to be deposited, the crowd had Lioreased to some 300 people, who cheered hastily as the work of depositing commenced. The stone is computed to weigh upwards of a ton, and it was with great difficulty and labour that it was placed in its old place. A lamp and some candles had been lent to allow the operators to do their work successfully, and about nine o'clock( it was completed to the satis faction of all present, the event being signalised by a round of cheers, again and again renewed. At a call from some of the parishioners three good heady cheers were given for Mr. Robert Hunt, who had dne his best to get the stone brought back. It is to the credit of the Fordington men that no disturbance took lace, there being no hooting or any evidences of rowdyism; everyone seemed pleased at their night's adveuture, and wishes were freely expressed that the authorities would not again meddle with the stone. A few minutes after nine the crowd gradually dwindled away, but before the company broke up a working man, whose years number over the three-score years and ten, did the light f intastio to the amuse ment of the onlookers, he asserting that the atone was all right, he having had his fling on it.", "annot": "A cart, or wheeled stand or table used to serve, transport or sell food, objects, luggage, etc, powered by people or animals", "newspaper_date": "1884-09-19", "newspaper_title": "The Poole Telegram.", "newspaper_place": "Poole, Dorset, England", "image_url": "https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/subject_location/d6d424f3-a7ed-462f-b926-853c3b1156e6.png", "image_url_conflict_values": null, "target": "trolley", "year": 1884, "x": -0.9271674156188965, "y": 1.1735376119613647}, {"Unnamed: 0": 302, "text": "Carrmirt.\u2014Ndword H.
